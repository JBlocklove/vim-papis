# vim-papis
Vim plugin to integrate papis more cleanly

I've been having some trouble with [papis-vim](https://github.com/papis/papis-vim) and I have a thesis to write, so I decided to try to make my own, more minimal, version.

I use Neovim, so I'm currently working on getting it to work with that specifically, but once I can get that I may look at making it usable for vim and gvim.


### Disclaimer
This is the first plugin I'm writing, so there's bound to be bad practice for vimscript EVERYWHERE. If you know what you're doing and want to help, please submit an issue or a pull request and help me make this actaully usable.

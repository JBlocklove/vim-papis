# vim-papis
Vim plugin to integrate papis more cleanly

I've been having some trouble with [papis-vim](https://github.com/papis/papis-vim) and I have a thesis to write, so I decided to try to make my own, more minimal, version.

I use Neovim, so I'm currently working on getting it to work with that specifically, but once I can get that I may look at making it usable for vim and gvim.
